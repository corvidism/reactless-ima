# React-less IMA.js

This is the equivalent of running DOOM on a calculator. Is it useful? No. Is it gonna be fun? Maybe! Lets find out.

## Steps

1. Replace React with a template renderer. Handlebars, maybe?
    - why: I need to figure out how to write custom `*PageRenderer`s.
    - also, it's funny because it's so stupid. I have no idea what will the FE code do. Sit there and wait for nothing, I guess????
2. ??? Do something on FE? 
3. Try to implement a renderer based on a different framework. Vue? Svelte? Something crazy like `htmx`? (... that would probably blow up.)
4. ... 
5. ~~profit~~ FUN.
